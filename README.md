## What is Py-Automator?

> Py-Automator is a modern Python framework for building declarative command-line interfaces<br> 
> with nested subcommands, designed for automation workflows and build systems.

Py-Automator is implemented in pure Python that enables scripting of more 
complicated tasks.


## Features
- ðŸš€ **Declarative Command Tree** - Define CLI structure through simple nested dictionaries
- ðŸ›  **Zero Boilerplate** - Focus on business logic, not argument parsing
- ðŸ“š **Automatic Help Generation** - Built-in help system with hierarchical documentation
- ðŸŒ³ **Hierarchical Commands** - Support for unlimited nested subcommands
- ðŸ–¥ **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Installation

You can use pip to install Py-Automator
```shell
pip install py-automator
```

## Build

Py-Automator uses Poetry for its build process. To build the wheel file 
and source distribution run:
```shell
poetry build
```

## Defining Commands

Create your command structure in a Python module:

```python
...

def setup_dev_env():
    """Initialize development environment"""
    print("Installing dependencies...")

AUTOMATION_TREE = {
    "setup-dev-env": {
        "help": "Initialize development environment",
        "func": setup_dev_env
    },
    "build": {
        "help": "Build artifacts",
        "subcommands": {
            "win-package": {
                "help": "Create Windows deployment package",
                "func": build_windows_package
            },
            "setup-exe": {
                "help": "Generate installer executable",
                "func": create_installer
            }
        }
    }
}

if __name__ == "__main__":
  from py_automator import automator
  automator.Automator(AUTOMATION_TREE).run()
```
